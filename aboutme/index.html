    <h2>Amoako Nicholas Kwabena</h2>
    <h2>Nicky Nickson</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! so my name is Nicholas and I am 25 years of age. Currently pursuing a degree in Applied Technology<br> but then already completed my first certificate in Computer Programming from BYUI and looking forwad to complete my second certificate<br> in Web Frontend Development by the end of the Year if things go right.
        <p>I actually love to play Video games and watch movies at my leisure time or perhaps will call them my hobbies.<br> I work with an IT firm and play the role as a Data entry specialist. I secured this job with my first Certificate and hoping that after my second,<br> I get to improve and move to a higher position or perhaps get a new job.
        </p><p> I love BYUI in the sense that, its teachings and practices  are centered on the Christ like attributes and I love the fact that the<br> school has wonderful instructors who always, I mean always want to see their students excel in a marvelous way and that they try to give in their all.<br></p><p>
        I feel the world is now a technological world where everything is about the internet and tech and so for me pursuing or choosing to desigh websites is a<br> great opportunity for me in the sense that,  I would be able to create websites of mine and host informations about my future Company<br> and also design for others and make some income from there since everything now is hosted on the web and that, having to design one<br> and hosting informations will be a lot of fun to me.
        I am taking this course because I will like to become a full Web Stack Developer and  so<br>I am hoping to learn the basics and also much of the things so as to help me achieve that goal of mine.</p>
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints for 9 years now with my entire family.<br> We actually got baptised the same day. We are five in number and that was a wonderful moment. I was happy to have<br> done that with my family.
        My favorite scripture is found in Matthew chapter 25, the verse 40 which talks about serves and that the blessing we get in serving others.<br> Looking Forward to learning with you all and making new friends through the course.
